**A repository for my humble hyprland config files.**

for your interest , it uses hyprland as the wayland compositor along with hyprpaper to set the wallpaper,waybar as the status bar whom are exucuted at launch .

the default terminal is [foot](https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/foot).

my favorite editor is neovim ,and i must admit that the configs of neovim are the consequences of me following [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) tutorials on how he setup neovim which i recommend to  understand how the config files are structred to be able to add your plugins if they are not present.

this is my first dotfiles so expect a lot of errors and stupid stuff .it is still not perfect as i have to configure drun and ncmpcpp and other stuff but for the time being ,i am happy with it.
